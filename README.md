A Notepad++ mimicker written in Python.

I got a lot of praise for it from my professor, and she wanted me to present it to the whole class due to the clean concise of the code. The program itself however, is rather simple.

I've been meaning to look back at this and add a lot more. Maybe make a fully functional Notepad++ clone.
